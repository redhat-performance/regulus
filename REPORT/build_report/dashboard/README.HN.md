> After I quit this claude code session, what should I tell claude when I return to this project later 

● When you return to this project in a future Claude Code session, here's what you should tell me:

  Quick Start Message:

  I'm continuing work on the Performance Benchmark Dashboard project.

  Project location: /home/hnhan/CLAUDE-PROJOECTS/report-proj/regulus/REPORT/build_report/dashboard

  Please read these files first to understand the project:
  1. dashboard/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md (technical implementation details)
  2. dashboard/README.md (user documentation)

  Current status: Dashboard is fully functional with all recent improvements applied.

  [Then describe what you want to work on next]

  Key Files I Should Read:

  1. dashboard/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md - Contains:
    - Architecture overview
    - Recent changes (Nov 21, 2025) with line numbers
    - Key implementation patterns
    - Code locations for common tasks
    - This is the PRIMARY file for future sessions
  2. dashboard/README.md - User-facing documentation
  3. /tmp/dashboard-test.log - Current dashboard logs if troubleshooting needed

  Additional Context to Include (if relevant):

  - Specific feature you want to add/fix: Be specific about what you need
  - Any errors you're seeing: Include error messages
  - Files you've modified: If you changed anything after this session
  - Dashboard URL: The dashboard runs at http://0.0.0.0:5000

  Example Return Message:

  I'm continuing the Performance Benchmark Dashboard project at:
  /home/hnhan/CLAUDE-PROJOECTS/report-proj/regulus/REPORT/build_report/dashboard

  Please read dashboard/TECHNICAL_NOTES.md to understand the recent changes.

  I need to add a new filter for "test duration" to the dashboard.

  The TECHNICAL_NOTES.md file I created is specifically designed to help future AI sessions (and you) quickly
  understand the codebase, so just point me to that file and I'll be up to speed quickly!
